<h1>Escape From the Cave</h1>

<p>
"Escape From the Cave" is an audio game that runs on a typical web
browser (such as Internet Explorer) with Adobe Flash Player.  This
game is supposed to be played without seeing the screen.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
"Escape From the Cave" is a unique audio game where
the player (you) is locked in a mysterious cave and try to escape from it.
There are ten different mazes (in the Normal Mode) where various obstacles
are placed to foil your attempt, or sometimes even threaten your life.
<p>
The game uses your keyboard as a maze grid. At the start, your position is
the "Z" key, which is normally located at the bottom left corner on the keybord.
The goal is to reach the upper right corner, which is the "0" key.
By pressing the key where you want to go, you can "feel" if there's a wall 
in that direction.
<p>
The game has two playing modes, the Normal Mode and Random Mode.

<h2>How To Play</h2>
<p>
Open the following link in a web browser
and the game will be automatically started.
To quit playing, simply close the browser
window or navigate away the page.
The use of headphone is recommended.

<h3>Note for screen reader users</h3>
<p>
While playing the game, the screen reader must directly
pass your keystrokes to a browser. This is different
from the way you normally use the browser, and you
can change the behavior of screen reader with the following keys.
You need to turn the "virtual cursor" mode off.
